# Crosscloud

Crosscloud is envisioned as a system of independently-operated apps
and servers which cooperate in giving people the freedom to move easily
between them.  At heart, the system will work by giving each user one
or more server "pods" where their data resides and having the apps operate on
that data through standard interfaces.  This separation means users
remain free to try out other software products and services, never
being locked in.   This has a variety of benefits, such as...

## Benefits

  - Innovation: Cool new stuff, which you can try out painlessly.  No social network lock in

  - Connection: For a variety of reasons, certain people you know probably can't or won't use any particular social networking platform, making it difficult to connect with them online and making it impossible to connect everyone in a large group.   With Crosscloud, people will have a wide variety of vendors and platforms to choose from; as long as each person can find one that works for them, you can all all be connected.

   - Stability: You can keep using the same version of the software as long as someone is willing to support it.  No more being forced to accept every product change or give up the product.

   - Security: Because crosscloud products never lock you are in, you are free to seek out providers who offer high levels of data security.   Because everyone is free to do this, we expect in time the market will provide great options here.

  - Privacy: Although some invasions of privacy are due to failures in data security, many are part of routine business on the Internet today.   Advertising supported products, in general, require users grant intimate access to their data.  Crosscould systems don't prevent such access, but they do give users freedom to choose alternatives.

  - Reliability: The overall system will have no single point of failure (given working Internet).  If any subsystem is repeatedly unreliable, users can easily switch providers.

  - Freedom of Choice: if you don't like it, you can go elsewhere.  If there's no where else to go, it's feasible to build your own place, or hire someone to. 

  - Appropriate Controls: The system is flexible about where control resides.  In consumer apps, it can stay with the user.   But with enterprise apps, it's feasible to have control remail with the enterprise.

  - Cost Savings: because the barriers to entry for competitors are much lower, prices are likely to be lower

## The Challenge

To make the crosscloud vision a reality, three main things have to happen:

### 1.  Research to Build a Prototype

There are some open questions in computer science about whether it's
feasible to build a decentralized system of this scale, with these
characteristics.

So building cimba, podserver, demo apps; publishing any new science.
Prove that it can be built by building it.

We encourage others to help, showing that it can be built.

### 2.  Establish Consensus Standards

If we know how to build a system like crosscloud, and we build three different ones that don't interoperate, we're not in good shape.

So it's important the people defining the protocols make a reasonable effort to come to consensus on those protocols before they become so widely deployed they are hard to update.

As such, we suggest a system cannot consider itself a "crosscloud" system unless it conforms to all relevant W3C recommendations and its makers are engaged and committed to conforming to new relevant standards.

### 3.  Grow an Active Marketplace

If we build a single, unified system with all the right scaling properties, if customers can't find the products they want, we wont be done.

This is going to require businesses seeing how they can make money supporting crosscloud.   But it's not that hard, etc, etc.

(Today, many developers are paid in part because they lock in users, so they will have incentives to work against crosscloud.   The bottom line generally relies on keeping customers happy, though, so ....)

- Reach out to other devs. 

* Help there be a thriving market of crosscloud servers (pod providers and other infrastructure elements)
