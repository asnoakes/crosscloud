# Crosscloud

Crosscloud is a system being developed to allow people to painlessly
move between applications, taking their data with them.  The name
comes from the observation that cloud-based software has a strong
tendency to lock users in, and we need a good way to cross between
these different "clouds".

Building crosscloud is an open source and open standards effort, as
various people work on the technical challenges and gradually
standardize bits that become well understood.  The technology stack is
based on [Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) and
standards work is primary done at W3C.

## Benefits

In a crosscloud world, where people retain control over their data and
the ability to use it anywhere, we will see several benefits:

  - **Innovation.** When your data and social connections are locked
      in to one platform or application, it's hard to try out
      interesting alternatives.  Even if you try them, it's hard to
      make the switch, because all your history and previous work is
      in your old system.  Your social connections are on the old
      system, too.  Can you get all your friends or colleagues to
      move at the same time?  And if people like you don't switch, new
      systems will fail for lack of users.  When users are locked in,
      innovaation is locked out.

  - **Connection.** For a variety of reasons, certain people you know
      probably can't or won't use any particular social networking
      platform.  This makes it hard to difficult to connect with them
      online, whether it's for real work or just for fun.  With a
      large enough group of people (sometimes only 5 or 10) it's
      impossible to find a platform they all use.  In contrast, With
      crosscloud, people will have a wide variety of vendors and
      platforms to choose from.  As long as each person can find one
      that works for them, you can all be connected.

  - **Stability.** You can keep using the same version of the software
      as long as someone is willing to support it.  No more being
      forced to accept every product change or give up the product.

  - **Security.** Because crosscloud products never lock you are in,
      you are free to seek out providers who offer high levels of data
      security.  Because everyone is free to do this, we expect in
      time the market will provide many strong options.

  - **Privacy.** Although some invasions of privacy are due to
      failures in data security, many are part of routine business on
      the Internet today.  Advertising supported products, in general,
      coerce users to grant intimate access to their data.  Crosscould
      systems don't prevent such access, but they do give users
      freedom to choose alternatives.

  - **Reliability.** The overall system will have no single point of
      failure (beyond IP connectivity and maybe the DNS).  If any
      subsystem is repeatedly unreliable, users can easily switch
      providers.

  - **Freedom of Choice.** If you don't like an application or data
      service provider, you can easily go elsewhere.  If there's
      no one in the market providing what you want, you can built it
      yourself (or hire someone to build it).

  - **Appropriate Controls.** The system is flexible about where
      control resides.  In consumer apps, it can stay with the user.
      But with enterprise apps, it's feasible to have control remain
      with the enterprise.

  - **Cost Savings.** because the barriers to entry for competitors
      are much lower, prices are likely to be lower.

## The Challenge

To make the crosscloud vision a reality, three main things have to happen:

### 1.  Research to Build a Prototype

There are some open questions in computer science about whether it's
feasible to build a decentralized system of this scale, with these
characteristics.

So building cimba, podserver, demo apps; publishing any new science.
Prove that it can be built by building it.

We encourage others to help, showing that it can be built.

### 2.  Establish Consensus Standards

If we know how to build a system like crosscloud, and we build three different ones that don't interoperate, we're not in good shape.

So it's important the people defining the protocols make a reasonable effort to come to consensus on those protocols before they become so widely deployed they are hard to update.

As such, we suggest a system cannot consider itself a "crosscloud" system unless it conforms to all relevant W3C recommendations and its makers are engaged and committed to conforming to new relevant standards.

### 3.  Grow an Active Marketplace

If we build a single, unified system with all the right scaling properties, if customers can't find the products they want, we wont be done.

This is going to require businesses seeing how they can make money supporting crosscloud.   But it's not that hard, etc, etc.

(Today, many developers are paid in part because they lock in users, so they will have incentives to work against crosscloud.   The bottom line generally relies on keeping customers happy, though, so ....)

- Reach out to other devs. 

* Help there be a thriving market of crosscloud servers (pod providers and other infrastructure elements)
