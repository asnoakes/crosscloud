This is an annotated bibliography of papers, talks, blog entries,
software tools, etc, likely to be of interest to people working on
crosscloud projects.

At some point soon this should probably be converted to a machine
readable format, and organized with tags or catagories or something.
Maybe bibtex (cf jabref) displayed using
[bibtex-js](https://code.google.com/p/bibtex-js/)?  Or something using
linked data?
